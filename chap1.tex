\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

Your introduction has two main purposes: 1) to give an overview of the main points of your thesis; and 2) awaken the reader’s interest. It’s not a bad idea to go through the introduction one last time when the writing is done, to ensure that it connects well with your conclusion.

\section{Overview}
The background sets the general tone for your thesis. It should make a good impression and convince the reader why the theme is important and your approach relevant. Even so, it should be no longer than necessary.

What is considered a relevant background depends on your field and its traditions. Background information might be historical in nature, or it might refer to previous research or practical considerations. You can also focus on a specific text, thinker or problem.

Academic writing often means having a discussion with yourself (or some imagined opponent). To open your discussion, there are several options available. You may, for example:

refer to a contemporary event
outline a specific problem; a case study or an example
review the relevant research/literature to demonstrate the need for this particular type of research
If it is common in your discipline to reflect upon your experiences as a practitioner, this is the place to present them. In the remainder of your thesis, this kind of information should be avoided, particularly if it has not been collected systematically.

Tip: Do not spend too much time on your background and opening remarks before you have gotten started with the main text.

a) “set the scene” with a (short) narrative
c) take an example from the media to give your topic current relevance.


\section{Goals of the project}

One of the first tasks of a researcher is defining the scope of a study, i.e., its area (theme, field) and the amount of information to be included. Narrowing the scope of your thesis can be time-consuming. Paradoxically, the more you limit the scope, the more interesting it becomes. This is because a narrower scope lets you clarify the problem and study it at greater depth, whereas very broad research questions only allow a superficial treatment.

The research question can be formulated as one main question with (a few) more specific sub-questions or in the form of a hypothesis that will be tested.

Your research question will be your guide as your writing proceeds. If you are working independently, you are also free to modify it as you go along.

How do you know that you have drafted a research question? Most importantly, a research question is something that can be answered. If not, you have probably come up with a theme or field, not a question.

Some tips:

Use interrogative words: how, why, which (factors/situations) etc.
Some questions are closed and only invoke concrete/limited answers. Others will open up for discussions and different interpretations.
Asking “What …?” is a more closed question than asking “How?” or “In what way?”
Asking “Why” means you are investigating what causes of a phenomenon. Studying causality is methodologically demanding.
Feel free to pose partially open questions that allow discussions of the overall theme, e.g., “In what way …?”; “How can we understand [a particular phenomenon]?”
Try to condense your research question into one general question – and perhaps a few more specific sub-questions (two or three will usually suffice).

\section{Outline}
The outline gives an overview of the main points of your thesis. It clarifies the structure of your thesis and helps you find the correct focus for your work. The outline can also be used in supervision sessions, especially in the beginning. You might find that you need to restructure your thesis. Working on your outline can then be a good way of making sense of the necessary changes. A good outline shows how the different parts relate to each other, and is a useful guide for the reader.








This is the introductory chapter.  This will give you some
ideas on how to use \LaTeX~\cite{lam1994} to typeset your document.
Here is a sample quote using the \verb+\munquote+ environment:

\begin{munquote}[~\cite{lam1994}]%
\LaTeX{} is a system for typesetting documents.  Its first widely
available version, mysteriously numbered 2.09, appeared in 1985.  \LaTeX{}
is now extremely popular in the scientific and academic communities, and
it is used extensively in industry.  It has become a \emph{lingua franca}
of the scientific world; scientists send their papers electronically to
colleagues around the world in the form of \LaTeX{} input.%
\end{munquote}

The citation at the end is optional --- if you don't need it,
then use \verb+\munquote+ without any arguments:

\begin{munquote}%
Here is a quote that does not have an associated citation
after it.  You can specify the citation before or after the
quote manually.%
\end{munquote}

By default, all text is double spaced, however, quotes and footnotes
must be singled spaced.\munfootnote{This is a single spaced footnote.
SGS requires that footnotes be singled spaced and this can be done with
the \texttt{$\backslash$munfootnote} command.} The left margin is slightly
wider than the right margin.  This is to compensate for binding.

An example mathematical formulae is show in
Equation~\ref{eqn:sum}.

\begin{muneqn}{sum}
\sum_{i = 0}^{n} i^2
\end{muneqn}

A slightly more complicated equation is given in Equation~\ref{eqn:schrodinger}:
\munfootnote{Equation taken from the \textsl{Schr\"{o}dinger equation}
entry on \textsl{Wikipedia}}

\begin{muneqn}{schrodinger}
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,\,t)=
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(x,\,t) + V(x)\Psi(x,\,t)
\end{muneqn}

\section{Cross References}
\label{sec:xrefs}

In addition to using \verb+\ref+ to refer to equations, you can also use
it (in conjunction with the \verb+\label+ command) to refer to sections
and chapters without hard coding the numbers themselves.  For example,
this is Section~\ref{sec:xrefs} of Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}.  You can
also refer to Appendix~\ref{apdx:somelabel}, Subsection~\ref{sec:nested}
below or any other place that has a \verb+\label+.  You can also use
labels to refer to a page.  For example, Chapter~\ref{chap:figtab}
starts on page~\pageref{chap:figtab}.

\section{Some Suggestions}

Here are a few recommendations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Before using this template, make sure you check with
		your supervisor.
	\item MUN's library provides electronic access to some \LaTeX{}
		related textbooks which can be read online.  Use
		the search term \texttt{latex (computer file)} on the
		Library's web page.
	\item If you run into a problem, Google may be a helpful resource.
	\item Concentrate on content, let \LaTeX{} handle the typesetting.
	\item Don't worry about warnings related to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item overfull \texttt{hboxes}/\texttt{boxes}
		\item underfull \texttt{hboxes}/\texttt{vboxes}
	\end{itemize}
	These can be corrected with modest rewording of your text prior
	to submission of your final copy.
\end{itemize}

\section{The \texttt{Makefile}}

You can use \texttt{make} to ``build'' your thesis on the Linux command
line\munfootnote{Linux is available on all machines running LabNet in
\textsl{The Commons} and in other computer labs on campus.} This will
automatically run the \texttt{bibtex} program to create your bibliography
and will also re-run \texttt{latex} as necessary to ensure that all
references are resolved.  A device independent file (\texttt{thesis.dvi})
will be created, by default.  If you are using this template in another
environment other than the Linux command line, then the \texttt{Makefile}
will probably not be useful to you.

\begin{itemize}
\item To make a PostScript copy of your thesis, type the following
at the command line:

\texttt{make thesis.ps}

\item To generate a PDF copy of your thesis, run:

\texttt{make thesis.pdf}

\item To generate a PDF/A-1b copy of your thesis (which should
satisfy the SGS's ethesis submission requirements):

\texttt{make ethesis.pdf}

\item To remove all the files generated by \texttt{bibtex} and
\texttt{latex}, use the command:

\texttt{make clean}

\item To remove the intermediate files, but leave the PostScript
and DVI/PDF files intact, use the command:

\texttt{make neat}
\end{itemize}

As you add or remove figures, chapters, or appendices to your thesis,
make sure you keep the \texttt{Makefile} upto date, too (see the
\texttt{FIGURES} and \texttt{FILES} macros in the \texttt{Makefile}).

\section{Changing Fonts}

Change fonts: {\Large Large},
\verb+verbatim ~@#$%^&*(){}[]+,
\textsc{Small Caps},
\textsl{slanted text},
\emph{emphasized text},
\texttt{typewriter text}.
