\section*{Goals of the Project}

The main goal of the project is to create tool, which partially compensates lack
of static type system for clojure programming language.\\

More precisely it covers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation, provided by type annotations
\item Ability to catch errors earlier and closer to problem location
\item Refactoring with greater confidence
\item Better error messages
\end{itemize}

There are also some issues, which static type system helps to solve, but they are not
addressed in this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster resulting programs
  (see \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGko70hIEwk&t=295s}{related work})
\end{itemize}

Most of following ideas can be applied for all functional languages with dynamic type system.\\

First of all it's necessary to understand, that code written in functional
language with persistent data structures are easy to test. It's especially
necessary to write tests for dynamically typed language, because it's very
hard to trace errors introduced earlier, it will be found only in runtime
and can be very far from place where exception raised. \\

Tests are good, but someone have to write them, also code in dynamically
typed language have lack of information about function and parameters
types.\\

One of the solutions is to write optional type annotations,
which can be used for generating project documentation/docstrings
and tests.
